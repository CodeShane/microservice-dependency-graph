Service Dependency Graph
====

This project is used to represent microservice dependency graph.


## Projects Description


### Service Stats


It's responsible for receive microservices data and returns that data in a graph format to be displayed by the Service Viewer project. All data is stored using the current time as an identification, so this way is possible to view data trough time.


This data in JSON format is sent through a HTTP POST to /calling URI, and it's represented by:

* Caller Name (Microservice that performs the call)
* Called Name (Microservice that receives the call)
* Called Endpoint Name (Microservice's endpoint that receives the call)


Example:

```json
{
  "serviceCaller":"checkout",
  "serviceCalled":"users",
  "endpointCalled":"findById"
}
```


#### Test

```sh
$ sbt test
```


#### Run

*It requires a Redis instance running.*


```sh
$ sbt run
```


#### How it works internally


##### Storing data


All data is stored into Redis using HASH format to represent graph data.

The key for Node/Vertex is **nodes:HH.mm** (HH is the hour and mm is the minute). Example: **nodes:17.41**

The key for Link/Edge is **edges:HH.mm** (HH is the hour and mm is the minute). Example: **edges:17.41**

The node's index is generated by a Redis String using the **inc** command.


##### Displaying Data


Currently is only possible to display a graph for a specific time (hour:minute).


##### What is missing


Add TTL to all data inserted, so this way there'll be no conflict among dates.


### Service Viewer


It's reponsible for displaying the graph in a browser.

It's just an HTML file (service-viewer/index.html) that you can open directly in your browser.
